This is why Cow Ghee has a dominant place in healing and rejuvenating in Ayurveda, and is abundantly used. There are two types of ghee mentioned in Ayurvedic texts ghee made from butter and ghee made from curd. Ghee made from butter increases our fat and ghee made from curd nourishes our tissues. Ghee made from butter increases our cholesterol whereas ghee made from curd decreases our cholesterol. THE PROCESS BILONA – CHURNING OF CURD Churning Process in making Ghee is seldom practiced now-a-days as it is time-consuming and costly.

                        </h2>
                        <p>

Our Mission is just not to provide the A2 Milk but also to improve the breed & spread the nos of the Gir Cow in the Northern region. This way we feel we will protect our future generations by ensuring supply of A2 milk. We do so by inseminating our herd of cows artificially with pure bred Gir Bull semen. We are , however, against this practise but we will shift to Natural Service in a year or two as our Bulls are being bred in our farms.
